# ElGamal-Encryption-CSHARP
ElGamal Encryption Algorithm in C#
School project. ElGamal Encryption Algorithm in Python As a result of the work,
a program was obtained that implements software encryption according to the El-Gamal method. 
The scheme was proposed by Taher El-Gamal in 1985. El-Gamal developed one of the variants of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. 
He improved the Diffie-Hellman system and obtained two algorithms, which are designed for encryption and for authentication. 
Unlike RSA, El-Gamal's algorithm is not patented, and thus has become a cheaper alternative, as no license fees are required. 
The algorithm is said to be covered by the Diffie-Gellman patent. Currently, public key cryptosystems are considered the most promising. 
Among them is the El-Gamal scheme, the crypto-resistance of which is based on the computational complexity of the discrete logarithm problem,
where it is necessary to calculate x from the known p , g and y.
